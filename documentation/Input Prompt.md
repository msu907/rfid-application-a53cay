I'm looking to build an application that can take information coming off fixed RFID readers and display that information in different visualizations for users. Users need to be able to see how many different assests have been tagged with RFID tags, the description of the item, and possibly a picture that has been uploaded. They also need to be able to annotate where it may have been stored. Another window/widget should enable users to see all historic reads coming off fixed or handheld readers, i.e. "last seen". Business logic should be able to be applied so that the same read at each site every second coming of the reader isn't duplicated, rather only if it changes position or every day it is seen in that location the record gets updated.
