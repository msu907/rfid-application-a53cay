## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- React 18.0+
- TypeScript 4.9+
- Redux Toolkit (state management)
- React Query (data fetching)
- Material-UI v5 (UI components)
- React-Leaflet (location visualization)
- Vite (build tool)

### State Management
- Redux Toolkit for global state
- React Query for server state
- React Context for theme/auth state
- Local component state where appropriate

### Data Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Action] --> B[Component]
    B --> C{State Type?}
    C -->|Server State| D[React Query]
    C -->|Global State| E[Redux]
    C -->|Local State| F[useState]
    D --> G[API Service]
    E --> H[Store]
    F --> I[Component State]
```

## Browser Support

| Browser | Minimum Version |
|---------|----------------|
| Chrome | 90+ |
| Firefox | 88+ |
| Safari | 14+ |
| Edge | 90+ |
| iOS Safari | 14+ |
| Chrome Android | 90+ |

### Polyfill Strategy
- Core-js for JavaScript features
- Automatic polyfill injection based on browserslist
- CSS vendor prefixing via PostCSS

## Performance

### Optimization Strategies
- Code splitting via React.lazy()
- Image optimization with modern formats
- Tree shaking of unused code
- Caching strategies for API responses
- Memoization of expensive computations

### Performance Metrics
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 3.0s
- Lighthouse Performance Score: > 90

## Security

### Implementation Guidelines
- HTTPS-only communication
- JWT token-based authentication
- XSS prevention via React's built-in escaping
- CSRF protection
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Secure cookie handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Development server not starting
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

2. Type checking errors
```bash
# Verify TypeScript configuration
npm run typecheck
```

3. Build failures
```bash
# Clean build directory
rm -rf dist
npm run build
```
