Design Elements:
1. Primary Icon (32x32):
- RFID antenna symbol rendered as a simplified curved line design
- Tag element represented by a small rectangle intersecting the antenna
- System brand colors using high contrast ratios

- Optimized edge contrast for small-scale visibility
- Reduced detail while maintaining recognizability
- Enhanced pixel-level optimization

Technical Requirements:
- ICO container format with multiple resolution support
- PNG-compressed images within ICO container
- Alpha channel support for transparency
- Browser cache optimization through proper headers

Implementation Notes:
1. Create using professional icon editing software (e.g., Adobe Photoshop, Affinity Designer)
2. Export with "Save for Web" or equivalent optimization
3. Verify rendering across specified browsers
4. Test favicon appearance in both light and dark browser themes
5. Validate ICO format structure and compression
